Have you ever tried to test strategies on TV on sub-minute timeframes? Why would you want to look at sub-minute? Because if the strategy works, you actually have more opportunities to make or lose money. 
The main requirement one needs to keep in mind before trying to do this is that a paid Tradingview account is needed in order to access sub-minute timeframes. Maybe that will change in the future.

What I have done here is to first scrape the strategy results. TV will only give those results for the last 10,000 candles. At 1-second level, they would usually give it for the last 24 hours. From experience, the Deep Backtesting produces unreliable outputs. Or, to say the least, if one runs the strategy regularly and then tries to run it in deep backtesting mode, the results are not the same. At least not for the low timeframes. 

1. Scraping is done using Selenium, executed once per day. It is rather slow, in case of many pairs/strategies/timeframes, you may want to run them in parallel in the cloud or set up a ws stream. Keep in mind this process is only for analysis, not for trading. Trading, on some of these timeframes, can only be high-frequency. 
2. Saving is done in gzipped csv as the file can get very big. I tried parquet as well but the file would not open after some time. It is also more difficult to add records to parquet files. And hdf5 would be too much of a complication for such a simple file. After adding some more parameters (time of day, day of the week, etc.), I am saving the df to a new file.
3. The analysis is done using pandas, mainly groupby. A special note on 'var' which is a <b>Price Range Relative Change</b> parameter. It basically establishes the minimum and maximum of the price within the interval and then computes the relative price change compared to the minimum. If - by mistake - the minimum is bigger than the maximum, then it sets the value to 1,000 just to alert you there's something wrong. 
4. Other useful parameters are: ratio, % of negative trades, etc.
