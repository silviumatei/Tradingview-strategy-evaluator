Have you ever tried to test strategies on TV on sub-minute timeframes? Why would you want to look at sub-minute? Because if the strategy works, you actually have more opportunities to make or lose money. 
The main requirement one needs to keep in mind before trying to do this is that a paid Tradingview account is needed in order to access sub-minute timeframes. Maybe that will change in the future.

What I have done here is to first scrape the strategy results. TV will only give those results for the last 10,000 candles. At 1-second level, they would usually give it for the last 24 hours. From experience, the Deep Backtesting produces unreliable outputs. Or, to say the least, if one runs the strategy regularly and then tries to run it in deep backtesting mode, the results are not the same. At least not for the low timeframes.
