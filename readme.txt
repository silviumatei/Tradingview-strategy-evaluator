Have you ever tried to test strategies on TV on sub-minute timeframes? Why would you want to look at sub-minute? Because if the strategy works, you actually have more opportunities to make or lose money. 
The main requirement one needs to keep in mind before trying to do this is that a paid Tradingview account is needed in order to access sub-minute timeframes. Maybe that will change in the future.
